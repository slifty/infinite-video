About the code
=============

The Server
-------------

This isn't a particularly deep project, but it does involve a database!  I know everyone hates PHP.  QQ moar please.

Models are in the models folder
No controllers, but instead actions are autorouted to the proper page
URL style is "something.com/?p=[page]&a=[action]
DIR style is /pages/[page]/[action].php

Server does the following:

1. Stores everything about the ads themselves
1. Generates a random remix hash


The Client
-------------
